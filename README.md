# Forensic Analysis based on Massive Mapping Data for Location Evidence from Browsing History

This forensic method helps confirm or disprove a suspect's whereabouts during the crime timeframe

The method is described in the research article *(link to be added upon publication)*

# Demonstration

Example of a crime location and digital trace found in browsing history

blue marker - crime location; red marker - digital trace in the suspectâ€™s browsing history

The analysis reveals that the suspect accessed a price list from a hotel located 700m from the crime scene

The hotel records confirm their stay during the crime timeframe, and CCTV footage documents their departure prior to the incident
